* **Generic greetings:**  Legitimate emails usually address you by name.  Phishing emails often use generic greetings like ""Dear Customer.""
* **Suspicious links:**  Hover your mouse over links before clicking to see the actual URL.  If it looks suspicious or doesn't match the sender's claimed organization, don't click it.
* **Grammar and spelling errors:**  Phishing emails often contain grammatical errors or poor spelling.
* **Requests for personal information:**  Legitimate organizations rarely ask for sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or social security numbers via email.
